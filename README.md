# Data Analysis Using SQL 

### Objectives

In this analysis, I will go through my data analysis process by analyzing an enterprise database of a DVD rental company and providing insights and recommedation for the company.
 
**About the sample database:** This database is comprised of 15 tables representing many business aspects of the company. The [Entity Relationship Model](https://sp.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/printable-postgresql-sample-database-diagram.pdf). (ERM) depicts this database schema. Data source and SQL scripts is posted on the repository.
