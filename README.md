# Data Analysis Using SQL 

### Introduction
This is data analysis project to showcase my analytical thinking ability and SQL knowledge. In this analysis, I will go through my data analysis process by analyzing an enterprise database of a DVD rental company and providing insights and recommedation for the company.

I used Postgres relational database system to load the sample database and write queries. Data source and SQL scripts is posted on the repository.  

**About the sample database:** This database is comprised of 15 tables representing many business aspects of the company. The **Entity Relationship Model** (ERM) depicts this databse schema.
