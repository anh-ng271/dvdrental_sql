# Data Analysis Using SQL 

### Introduction
This is data analysis project to showcase my analytical thinking ability and SQL knowledge.

In this analysis, I will go through my data analysis process by analyzing an enterprise database of a DVD rental company and providing insights and recommedation for the company.

I used Postgres relational database system to load the sample database and write queries. Data source and SQL scripts is posted on the repository.  

**About the sample database:** This database is comprised of 15 tables representing many business aspects of the company. The [**Entity Relationship Model**] (https://sp.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/printable-postgresql-sample-database-diagram.pdf) (ERM) depicts this databse schema.
